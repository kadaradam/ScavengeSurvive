Support the development of this mod by donating. I can put more time into adding new features!

## A PvP SA:MP server script

The aim of the game is to find supplies such as tools or weapons to help you survive, either alone or in a group.

The overall objective is to build a stable community and defend it from players with more hostile intentions.

Items spawn around the map in various places categorised by type, rarity and location. Vehicles are rare and spawn with damaged engines or tires and will usually spawn with loot inside the trunk.

No gameplay mechanics require the use of commands. All gameplay has been built with an intuitive _interaction model_ in mind with only 5 major keys required to access the gamemode-specific features.


## Development

The gamemode is written in a modular fashion, borrowing a lot of concepts from object-oriented programming. The "World" scripts are separated and can be completely replaced for a new map.

I encourage people to play around with this code, create a new map and put loot spawns in it or completely mod it into a new gamemode, I would love to see what creations are made! Please publish all bug fixes in order to benefit everyone.

### Don't Be Selfish

When you fix something, don't keep it to yourself. This is an open source project. An important part of open source is sharing, that's why this code is free of charge and available to all.

Please respect this. Feel free to keep your unique features private, just submit *all* fixes to the base code as pull requests or just email them to me.

### Builds

Each time I compile a version of the gamemode, the build number (stored in BUILD_NUMBER) is incremented. This is also shown in-game at the top-right of the screen and will allow players and developers to know which version is in use which can help track issues and fix bugs.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE THE BUILD SCRIPT YOURSELF! The reason for this is that you'll change the build number which is meant to reflect which BASE version of the gamemode you are using, NOT your own builds. This will greatly improve my ability to fix issues on your server.


## Setup

**What version do I use?**

If you're running a *public server* use the latest [release](https://github.com/Southclaw/ScavengeSurvive/releases). It *should* be stable but remember, this is a constantly evolving project and bugs always slip through!

If you want to hack on the code and contribute, pull the latest commit.

### 1. Dependencies

Ensure you have ALL the dependencies listed in the master script (the one you compile from!) each #include line has a link to the release page.

### 2. `scriptfiles/` directory

The server will automatically create any required directories such as `scriptfiles/data/`.

If you want to use the maps provided in the repository, extract `scriptfiles/Maps.zip` to `scriptfiles/`

### 3. Compile!

If you have a problem compiling **DON'T SUBMIT AN ISSUE HERE!** this is reserved for actual bugs.

If you set up all the dependencies correctly, there should be *no* errors or warnings at all unless mentioned in the commit message.

### 4. Set up plugins and filterscripts in your `server.cfg` file.

Note: The repo contains *many* filterscripts, most of these are just testing tools and utilities, there are only *2* filterscripts you need to run on a public server:
```
filterscripts object-loader rcon
plugins crashdetect streamer sscanf CTime Whirlpool FileManager irc MapAndreas
```

### 5. Set up gamemode settings in your `scriptfiles/data/settings.ini` file

This is an INI file with game settings that will self-create if absent.

Most of the settings should be self-explanitory. If the purpose isn't clear, look up the setting in the source code for more information.

### 6. (Optional) Set up "missing features"

Scavenge and Survive is now provided as a baseline to build from and many older features have been stripped out and are being developed privately. This is partly to deter inexperienced users from attempting to run a SS server/community. I hate to do this and it goes against everything I believe in when it comes to open source but it's something I had to do to prevent problems between communities and people using my work without giving proper credit.

Missing features:

#### Entity Storage (items, safeboxes, tents, defences, signs)

You will need to devise your own system for storing safeboxes, tents, defences and signs.

This does not affect players and vehicles, these systems are still public so you can still run a basic server.

#### Tree generator bitmap

This is simply a 6000 x 6000 bitmap that determines tree placement.
See generate_trees.py for information.
